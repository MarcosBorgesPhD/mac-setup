![Python](../../../assets/python.png)

[Python](https://www.python.org), created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, is a widely used programming language praised for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Its clean syntax makes it easier to read and write code compared to languages like C, C++, or Rust.

## Considerations

There are many ways to install Python, and I recommend using the `uv` package manager for the best experience. Other options like `conda`, `pyenv`, or the official installers from Python.org are reliable and effective but may become limiting as your Python expertise grows.

Just know that `uv` will help you with tasks like:

- Installing specific Python versions
- Creating and managing virtual environments
- Installing and managing Python packages and tools
- Replacing several tools like `conda`, `pyenv`, `pip`, `poetry`, `virtualenv`, and more

## Installing Python with `uv`

<Steps>

1. Install `uv`

    ```bash
    brew install uv
    ```

2. Update your shell PATH

    ```bash
    uv tool update-shell
    ```

    <Aside type="note">
    You may need to restart your terminal.

3. Install Python

    ```bash
    uv python install
    ```

</Steps>

## Running Python Code

```bash
uv run my_python_script.py
```

## Launching the Python Interpreter

```bash
uv run python
```

## Launching the IPython Interpreter

IPython is a powerful interactive Python shell that provides a rich environment for data exploration, experimentation, and visualisation. It offers features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and the ability to execute code line by line. It is great for interactive learning and experimentation.

<Steps>

1. Install IPython

    ```bash
    uv tool install ipython --with pip
    ```

2. Launch the IPython Interpreter

    ```bash
    ipython
    ```

</Steps>

## Launching the JupyterLab

JupyterLab is a web application for creating interactive documents that combine code, text, equations, and rich visuals. It provides Python learners with an intuitive environment for coding and experimentation.

<Steps>

1. Install JupyterLab

    ```bash
    uv tool install jupyterlab
    ```

2. Launch JupyterLab

    ```bash
    jupyter-lab
    ```
</Steps>

## Working on projects

Create a new Python project

```bash
uv init hello-world
```

Run the hello-world `main.py` example

```bash
uv run ./hello-world/main.py
```

`uv` will create the following files

<FileTree>

- hello-world
    - .git
    - .venv
        - bin
        - lib
        - pyvenv.cfg
    - .gitignore
    - main.py
    - pyproject.toml
    - README.md
    - uv.lock

</FileTree>

## Using Python environments

Create a virtual environment at `.venv`

```bash
uv venv
```

You can create a virtual environment with a specific Python version

```bash
uv venv --python 3.13
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install a package in the virtual environment

```bash
uv pip install ...
```

List all installed packages in the virtual environment

```bash
 uv pip list
```

Exit the virtual environment

```bash
deactivate
```
