Hi, I'm Marcos Borges, a Research Engineer specializing in AI, Computer Vision, and Sensor Fusion.

For over 15 years, I've designed and built real-world systems for autonomous navigation, remote sensing, and target tracking, while leading engineering teams and managing complex R&D projects.

I work with researchers and engineers who want more than surface-level learning. If you're overwhelmed by the pace of AI or unsure where to focus, I can help you cut through the noise with a clear path and sharp learning strategies.

Whether you're mastering Python, C++, Rust, Swift, or building a portfolio that lands serious opportunities, I can help you gain the tools and confidence to move forward with purpose.
