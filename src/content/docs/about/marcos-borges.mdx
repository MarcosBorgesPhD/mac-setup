Hi, I'm Marcos Borges, a Senior Computer Vision Engineer decoding AI, Machine Learning, Target Tracking, and Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Navigation.

For over two decades, I've navigated the same overwhelming tech landscape you're now, going from selling ice cream to earning a PhD in Applied Mathematics.
I learned what it takes to cut through the noise, build a standout portfolio, and become a highly in-demand specialist.

Now, I'm dedicated to helping engineers move beyond surface-level knowledge so they can build a legacy of impact, not just a career.
