**Vim** is a **modal text editor** with distinct modes for different tasks.

Understanding these modes is key to using Vim effectively:

- **Normal** (default): For navigation, editing commands, and text manipulation.
- **Insert**: For typing and inserting text.
- **Visual**: For selecting text blocks.
- **Command-line**: For executing commands.

```

## Vim window management
